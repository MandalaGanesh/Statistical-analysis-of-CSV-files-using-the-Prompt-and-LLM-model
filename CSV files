The statistical analysis of CSV files using the Prompt and Large Language Models (LLMs) leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret, analyze, and summarize data efficiently. By inputting prompts related to data statistics, LLMs can perform various analyses such as descriptive statistics, correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing on CSV data. This approach simplifies the traditionally complex process of statistical analysis, making it accessible even to those with minimal programming skills. The synergy between prompt engineering and LLM capabilities revolutionizes data analysis, offering insights and trends from raw CSV files in an intuitive, human-readable format.
